"""Fix NVFP4 EMULATION backend for compressed-tensors on GB10.

Two bugs in run_nvfp4_emulations():

1. Weight scales stored in LINEAR format but dequantize_to_dtype() calls
   convert_swizzled_to_linear() unconditionally, corrupting them.
   Root cause: convert_to_nvfp4_linear_kernel_format has no EMULATION case,
   so scales remain in their original linear format from safetensors.

2. weight_global_scale is inverted (1/actual_gs) by compressed-tensors
   process_weights_after_loading, but dequantize_to_dtype divides by it,
   effectively multiplying by actual_gs instead of dividing.

Fix: Replace run_nvfp4_emulations with a version that:
- Uses linear scales directly (no swizzle conversion)
- Detects inverted weight_global_scale (< 1.0) and re-inverts it

Compatible with vLLM v0.16.x and v0.19.x — uses pattern matching with
fallback for API changes.
